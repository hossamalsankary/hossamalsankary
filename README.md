Hi, I'm Hossam, a Dev-ops engineer who loves closing the gap between actions needed to quickly change an application,
and the tasks that maintain its reliability. I currently work on my skills in the unification and automation of processes.
Iâ€™d love to combine my passion for programming and building and automating the infrastructure and building the CI/CD pipeline.
I would like to have a chance to build scalable back-end systems within cloud-based platforms.
